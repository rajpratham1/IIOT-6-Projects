## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Unified Routes**: Each website gets its own URL prefix (e.g., `/clinic/`, `/hotel/`)
2. **Template Organization**: Templates are organized by app in separate folders
3. **Static File Handling**: Each app's CSS, JS, images are in separate static folders  
4. **Landing Page**: Beautiful homepage showing all available websites
5. **Easy Navigation**: Click any card to visit that specific website
